# Now we will do the timing analysis as well as print out the critical path

# Generating timing analysis information


# Printing out the critical paths as well as get them
# back as an array.


# ------------------------------- Area Analysis -------------------------- #

# Estimates for the area that would be used up if the
# circuit was printed as an ASIC.




# --------------------------------- Synthesis ---------------------------- #

# Synthesis is the operation of reducing the circuit into simpler components.
# The base synthesis function breaks down the more complex logic operations
# into logic gates (keeping registers and memories intact) as well as reduces
# all combinatorial logic into operations that only use 1-bitwidth wires.
#
# This synthesis allows for PyRTL to make optimizations to the net structure
# as well as prepares it for further transformations on the PyRTL toolchain.
